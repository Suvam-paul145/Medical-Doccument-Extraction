# ⚠️ SECURITY WARNING ⚠️
# This API key is exposed in the client-side bundle via the envPrefix
# configuration in vite.config.ts. This means the API key can be extracted
# from the browser's developer tools.
# 
# Before deploying, ensure your API key has:
# - Proper usage limits and quotas configured in Google Cloud Console
# - API restrictions to limit which APIs the key can access
# - Application restrictions to limit which domains can use the key
#
# For production, consider using a backend proxy to keep your API key secure.
